Steps to run:
1. Get you YouTube API key (Refer: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)
2. Add key to src/api/YoutubeAPI.tsx file. (Try not mention it directly, use environment variables and access key using that)
3. Make sure you have Node.Js installed in the environment where the application is going to be deployed.
4. Open command prompt or shell window with working directory set with project base directory, i.e. directory where project resides
5. Type "npm install" (without quotes) - this will install all the required packages
6. Type "npm start" (without quotes) - this will start the application at port (3000 by default, can be modified)
